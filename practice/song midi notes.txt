Verse 1: I’m the rhythm to your heartbeat, feel the sound,
Every step that I take, you’re the ground.
I’m the breeze when the summer feels too hot,//
In the silence of the night, you’re the thought.//

or

I’m the spark in your eyes when we first meet,
Every step that I take, you’re the beat.
I’m the warmth when the world feels too cold,
In the quiet of the night, you're the story untold.

Chorus:
Feel the waves crashing in my soul,
You’re the piece that makes me whole.//
Every glance, it’s like we’re meant to be,//
You’re the fire that sets me free.//

or

Feel the tides moving deep inside,
You’re the piece that fits my stride.
Every glance says we’re bound by fate,
You’re the flame that makes me great

Verse 2:
Like the rain, I’m falling for your skies,//
In your eyes, I see what never dies.//
Every word I speak, it’s all for you,
In this world of mine, you’re the truth.//

or

Like the rain, I fall where your heart lies,
In your eyes, I see my forever rise.
Every word I whisper is meant for you,
In my world, you’re the light shining through

or

Like a gentle breeze on a starlit night,
In your laughter, my heart takes flight.
Every word I whisper, a promise made,
In this moment, our love won’t fade

Chorus:
Feel the waves crashing in my soul,
You’re the piece that makes me whole.//
Every glance, it’s like we’re meant to be,//
You’re the fire that sets me free.//

Bridge:
In the shadow, you’re the guiding light,
No wrong turns, 'cause you make it right.
You’re the echo in my quiet dreams,/or/You’re the dream I hold when the world sleeps,
Without you, nothing’s as it seems.

or

In your eyes, I find my home,
With you, I’ll never feel alone.
You’re the heartbeat that sings in my chest,
Together, our love will stand the test

Chorus (Refrain):
Feel the waves crashing in my soul,
You’re the piece that makes me whole.//
Every glance, it’s like we’re meant to be,//
You’re the fire that sets me free.//

3rd line of the verse 1 is not touching heart , 4th line of the verse 1 and 2nd line of chorus is very good but say in other way to feel more lovey mean,
4th and 5th line does feel to me as lovely lines in terms of 'love in college',1st line of verse 1 feels the line is already in many songs so need a unique line on that place,
2nd line of verse 2 i cant understand so need the lyric to be understandable meaning , 4th line is ok but need  a change ,in the 3rd line of Bridge not feel lovely



I’m the spark in your eyes when we first meet,

You’re the piece that fits my stride.
